# Inspiration

When you have a medical emergency, you go to the ER. Key word EMERGENCY. Often when you get there, you're asked to wait for your name to be called. 5 hours later, they call you up, not to meet a doctor, but to take a screening assesment of your symptoms. We saw this as a rather large inefficiency in what is supposed to be the fastest way to receive medical attention. 

That's why we built Symplified, an app that reduces time in the ER's waiting room.
