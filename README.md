# Inspiration

When you have a medical emergency, you go to the ER. Key word EMERGENCY. Often when you get there, you're asked to wait for your name to be called. 5 hours later, they call you up, not to meet a doctor, but to take a screening assesment of your symptoms. We saw this as a rather large inefficiency in what is supposed to be the fastest way to receive medical attention. 

That's why we built Symplified, an app that reduces time in the ER waiting room by pre-screening patients for symptoms.

# What it does

Symplified collects basic information from users through a simple survey. Then users are able to take photos of their medical conditions and use Symplified's text-to-speech capabilities to describe their symptoms. Once the user enters all their information, Symplified uses a custom prompt to query Google Gemini to parse user input. All of this data is maintianed in MongoDB Atlas and is accessible to doctors using Symplified.  Once Doctors log in via Auth0's authentication services, they are able to see a dashboard of patients orderded by the severity of their medical conditions. Doctors can then select who to examine next, streamlining the processes from ER waiting room to being face-to-face with a doctor.
